District Nainital - Geospatial Data Platform

📖 Overview
This project is a live geospatial data server and visualization platform designed specifically for district planners and administrators of Nainital. Its primary goal is to provide a centralized, real-time interface for accessing and visualizing critical spatial data for the Nainital district, including:

Administrative Boundaries

River and Stream Networks

Village-Level Geographic Information

The application synchronizes with a secure database to ensure that the most current geographical shapefiles are available for analysis, planning, and decision-making.

✨ Key Features
Real-time Data Sync: Automatically connects to a secure database to download and update geographical boundaries, river streams, and village data for Nainital.

Live Visualization: The server provides a dynamic view of the district's geography.

Planner & Administrator Focus: The interface and data layers are curated for administrative and planning use-cases.

MongoDB Integration: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage and streaming, enabling a responsive, live data feed.

🚀 Live Demo
A live version of the application is hosted on Render and can be accessed here:
https://district-nainital.onrender.com

Note: The live server may display "Awaiting MongoDB Live Stream" if the database is not currently active or streaming data. This is expected behavior when the backend data source is not publishing updates.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Backend: Node.js (Inferred)

Database: MongoDB (for storing and streaming geospatial data)

Hosting: Render

Data Format: Spatial Shapefiles

🔧 Local Development & Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed

MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git
cd [your-repo-name]
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

text
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
Seed the database (Optional):
If you have initial shapefiles for Nainital, you would need to import them into your MongoDB collection. The specific script for this is not detailed in the live app but would typically be a custom import routine.

Running the Server
Start the server locally:

bash
npm start
The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or the port you have configured).

📊 Data Synchronization Workflow
The following diagram illustrates the high-level data flow:

Data Source: The latest spatial data (shapefiles) for Nainital is stored in a MongoDB database.

Synchronization: The server application connects to this database.

Live Stream: It listens for updates and streams the geographical boundaries, rivers, and villages.

Visualization: The client interface (the web page) renders this data on an interactive map.
